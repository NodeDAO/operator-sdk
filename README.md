Made by:   [HashKing](https://www.hashking.com/)




## Config
For more information about the full configuration and its default values, see:  [conf/config-default.yaml](./conf/config-default.yaml)

If you need to use a configuration file to operate, you need to call:
```go
config.InitConfig("<YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.yaml>")
logger.InitLog(config.GlobalConfig.Log.Level, config.GlobalConfig.Log.Format)
```
> `config.InitConfig` conf/config-default.yaml is loaded by default, specifying that other configuration files will be merged with configurations.



##  Installation

```go
go get github.com/NodeDAO/operator-sdk
```



## Operator support
Operator integration into Node DAO requires the following:
1. Accumulated over 32 ETH, register Validator. see: [docs/registerValidator](docs/registerValidator)
2. The user initiates unstake, and the operator needs to exit the Validator. seeï¼š[docs/exitscan](docs/exitscan)
